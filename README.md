# Python-Project
This project explores the interdependencies and forecasting of three key market indicators: Bitcoin prices, S&P 500 index levels, and Crude Oil prices. Using historical data, the project examines trends and relationships among these indicators, applying time-series forecasting techniques to predict future values. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the first 50 rows of the dataset, using ARIMA modeling to generate 30-step forecasts for each indicator. The results aim to provide insights into market dynamics and the predictive power of statistical models, while also serving as a foundation for future analysis with advanced forecasting techniques like LSTM and Prophet.
